# artworks

Repository archiving all my artworks.

All "pdn" files are project files for the program Paint.NET, alongside "paint" files being project files for Microsoft Paint on Windows 11. 

I used Microsoft Paint for a long time but have long since moved to Paint.NET. 

Also note that I often archive drawings from larger pieces of work with the same overarching number but with a decimal following it to signify its association.
